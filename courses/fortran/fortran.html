      <p>Fortran is a third-generation, compiled, imperative programming language that is 
          especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing. Fortran was originally developed by IBM with a reference manual 
          being released in 1956 however, the first compilers only began to produce accurate code two years later. Fortran computer programs 
          have been written to support scientific and engineering applications, such as numerical weather prediction, finite element analysis, 
          computational fluid dynamics, plasma physics, geophysics, computational physics, crystallography and computational chemistry. 
          It is a popular language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers.</p>

      <h3>Hello, World!</h3>
      <p>First of all to make a working program you need to write <code_block>program program_name</code_block> at the very beginning of the code and
      <code_block>end program program_name</code_block> at the end of it. Printing is very simple, you can do it in diffrent ways but we will stick with the most
      common one for now. To print write <code_blokc>print</code_blokc> followed by printing way specificator, a comma and text to print inside of 
      <code_block>"..."</code_block>. To make sure everything is working add <code_block>implicit</code_block> at the beginning of the program, it will be
      useful later but it's a good habit to always add it. So with all that in mind here is the hello world program:</p>
      <pre><code class="fortran-code">program hello
  implicit none
  print *, "hello world!"
end program hello</code></pre>
